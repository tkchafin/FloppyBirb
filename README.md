# FloppyBirb
A Java implementation of "Flappy Bird" which I have modified according to my own tastes. This was my first Java project (ever)- so if you decide to take a look at this code and have any pointers, feel free to send them my way

Build by executing ./build.bash

Play the game with java src/Game
